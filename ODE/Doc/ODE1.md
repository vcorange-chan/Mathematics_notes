# 1. What is differential equation and solution?

Our study is the following differential equation 

$$
\tag{1.1.1} 

\frac{d\bar x}{dt} = f(t, \bar x)
$$

where $f: I \times \Omega \rightarrow R^n$, $I$ a subinterval of $R$. $x \in \Omega$, $t \in I$. 

## Explaination:

Letâ€™s imagine a physical scenario; the form of the equation for this problem will become very easy to understand.

$\bar x$ denotes the `displacement`, $t$ is `time`, $\frac{d\bar x}{dt}$ is `velocity` as $v$ in physics. Because `velocity` is determined by `time` and `displacement`, we can also write $v$ as $f(t, \bar x)$. 



Our goal is solving the equation when we already know the  `velocity` but dont know the `displacement`.  For example, to predict the path of a typhoon, the typhoon's movement speed has already been detected, and we need to solve for its position tomorrow. 



# 2. What is Initial Value Problem?

**Definition 1.1.1** The Initial Value Problem (IVP) corresponding to Eq. (1.1.1) is given by 

$$
\tag{IVP-1.1.1}
\frac{d\bar{x}}{dt} = f(t, \bar{x}(t))  \\

\bar{x}(t_0) = \bar{x}_0 
$$

Actually, equation (1.1.1)  has infinitely many solution. Like both a typhon near Taiwan and a Hurricane on Atlantic Ocean have same velocity $f(t, \bar x )$ , but different positions. This is the motivation for specifying the initial value $\bar x(t_0)=\bar x_0$. 



$t_0$ denote the initial time, $\bar x_0$ is the initial position.  (Note: displacement $\bar x $ is a vector)

# 3. Definition of Solution

**Definition 1.1.2:** A function $\bar x(t)$ is said to be a solution of the *IVP-1.1.1* if $\exist J \sub I$, containing $t_0$ such that $\bar x(t)$ is differentiable on $J$ with $\bar x(t) \in \Omega$ for all $t \in J$ and $\bar x(t)$ satisfies Eq. (1.1.1)



- If $\bar x(t)$ is not differentiable on $J$, the equation $\frac{d\bar x}{dt}$ doesn't make sense. 

- Why restrict the interval to $J$ instead of the entire $I$ ? Because the initial value $t_0$ can only guarantee a local solution. 

## Counterexample 1.

Consider the differential equation 

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}=x^2
$$

with $x(0)=1$. The solution is $x(t)=\frac{1}{1-t}$, which is only valid for $t<1$.  For $t >1$, $x(t)$ can not be negative. 

## Recall: Fundamental Theorem of Caculus

### Proposition 1.1.1

Assume that $f: I \times \Omega \rightarrow R^n$ is continuous. 

$\bar x(t)$ is a solution of the IVP-1.1.1 if and only if 

$$
\tag{1.1.2}
\bar x(t) = \bar x_0 + \int_{t_0}^tf(s, \bar x(s))ds, t\in J
$$






# 4. The Existence of Solution

From the previous counterexample 1. , we found that sometimes a solution does not exist. How large should $J$ be chosen? When does a solution exist and when does it not? These are the questions we need to address next.
